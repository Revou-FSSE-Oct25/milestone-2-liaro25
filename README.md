# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

_A JavaScript mini-game created for the RevoFun Milestone 2 project.  
I named it **“Janken Pon - じゃんけんぽん！”** because it’s a game my kids play every
single day — at school, at the park, and even at home._

_I dedicated this to my children — so they can play something their Mama
built, share it with their friends, and proudly say, “This is my Mama’s made game.”_

## Rules of the Game

Rock, Paper, Scissors — or **Janken** in Japanese — is a classic game where the player chooses an option and the computer randomly selects one as well. It is **Player vs Computer**.

The winner is determined by the following rules:

- **🪨Rock (グー / Gū) beats ✂️Scissors (チョキ / Choki)**
- **✂️Scissors (チョキ / Choki) beats 🔖Paper (パー / Pā)**
- **🔖Paper (パー / Pā) beats 🪨Rock (グー / Gū)**

If the result is a draw (**あいこ / Aiko**), the game continues just like Japanese kids play, and the screen will show **あいこでしょ！(Aiko desho!)** before the next round starts.

This mini-game is built using **HTML, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript**, with dynamic interactions and real-time score updates.

### Sound Effects

The game includes a total of five original sound effects using real Japanese
Janken expressions:

1. **“じゃんけんぽん！” (Janken pon!)**

   - Used at the start of each round
   - Romaji: _janken pon!_

2. **“あいこでしょ！” (Aiko desho!)**

   - Used when the result is a draw
   - Romaji: _aiko desho!_

3. **Win Sound — “勝ち！” (かち！ / Kachi!)**

   - Japanese kids shout this when they win

4. **Lose Sound — “負け！” (まけ！ / Make!)**

   - Used naturally by kids when they lose

5. **Draw Sound — “あいこ！” (Aiko!)**
   - The standard word for "tie" in Janken

All five voice recordings are special because I specifically asked my kids and
their Japanese friends at school to record the sounds.  
This gives the game a fun, real, and authentic Japanese playground atmosphere.
